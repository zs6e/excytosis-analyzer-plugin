# Exocytosis-analyzer-plugin (named ExoJ)
    ExoJ is a Fiji/ImageJ2 plugin to automate the detection and the analysis of exocytosis in fluorescent time series
    
    Our website (<https://www.project-exoj.com/>) is experiencing some instabilities.
    
    You can find the two latest versions of our plugin (v1.83 and v1.9):
        * Legacy version: v1.83
        * Version 1.9: Code was modified to enable multithreading process (this should significantly speed up the detection and analysis)
